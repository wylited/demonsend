# Demonsend

A daemon and command line client utility for [localsend](https://localsend.org), powered by [localsend-rs](https://github.com/wylited/localsend).

Supports IPC through the unix socket at `/tmp/demonsend.sock`

NOTE: This repository depends on the bleeding edge version of localsend-rs. This will remain as so until the v1.0.0 release.
